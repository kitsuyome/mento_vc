Docket lets you write tests in plain English. Then we keep those tests in sync with how users actually interact with your product ‚Äî no more flaky selectors or stale test scripts.
THE PROBLEM
E2E tests are a pain to write ‚Äî and an even bigger pain to maintain.
Writing Cypress or Playwright tests is time-consuming and brittle
Even no-code tools require manually defining flows or relying on flaky CSS selectors
Every UI change risks breaking your suite, forcing teams to either spend hours fixing tests or just give up and test manually
Most teams hit the same tradeoff: move fast and break things ‚Äî or slow down to ensure quality.
OUR SOLUTION
Docket lets you:
Write tests in plain English (""Log in, Search for Y Combinator t shirt, Add 2 shirts to cart"")
Skip the brittle selectors ‚Äî we use multimodal agents that interact with the page like humans
Automatically keep tests up to date with real user session data
MEET THE TEAM
We‚Äôre Nishant and Boris ‚Äî two engineers who dreaded writing tests so much, we started a company to fix it.
We met while working at AWS, and between us, we‚Äôve built and shipped products at Stripe, Citadel, Brex, and Patreon. But testing was always the drag. Writing tests took forever. Keeping them working was even worse. We constantly felt the pain of choosing between moving fast and having confidence in our code.
So we‚Äôre building the tool we wish we had: Docket ‚Äî tests in plain English that stay up to date, without the maintenance burden.
LAUNCH OFFER
As part of our launch, we‚Äôre offering free complete test suite implementations for our next 10 customers. Book a demo here!

As writing code becomes increasingly accessible, it's easier than ever to accidentally expose API keys, database credentials, SSH private keys, and more.
TLDR: BitPatrol detects secret leaks in your source code that traditional scanners miss, helping you prevent costly data breaches.
üé• Launch Video: Watch here
THE PROBLEM
Secret leaks are happening every day, impacting companies across every industry. Traditional scanning tools attempt to catch these leaks using rigid regex patterns and keyword matching.
However, these methods struggle with secrets that don't follow set patterns, allowing critical leaks like these to slip through undetected.
OUR SOLUTION
Unlike legacy tools that rely on regular expressions, BitPatrol uses our proprietary machine learning model to detect secrets based on code context and developer intent ‚Äì not just string patterns.
Once our model flags a potential secret, we reference it against our dataset of billions of public commits, docker images, and open source packages. This helps us rapidly assess the secret's exposure frequency, drastically reducing false positives and solving the issue of alert fatigue.
Using our GitHub App, you can trigger actions that occur when a secret is detected, including automated alerts and custom workflows to immediately respond and remediate when a secret is leaked.
THE TEAM
BitPatrol was founded by Chris Lambert, a former Stripe engineer who quickly rose to the top 2% globally on HackerOne after uncovering secret leaks at some of the world‚Äôs largest companies‚Äîmany of which were actively using our competitor‚Äôs tools.

Spring 2025,Theorem,"Program verification so even your systems engineers can vibecode. Founded in 2025 by Rajashree Agrawal and Jason Gross, Theorem has 2 employees based in San Francisco, CA, USA.","ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE, B2B, CYBERSECURITY",2025.0,2.0,San Francisco,0.0,https://theoremlabs.com/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/theoremlabs,True,"TL;DR: PLEASE GIVE US YOUR MOST COMPLICATED CODING PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECT. SIGN UP!
Hello World! We‚Äôre Jason and Rajashree! We think AI code generation is going to be bigger than any of us can imagine.
MISSION
Theorem is an AI and programming languages research lab. Our question: as the models get better at generating code, what is the bottleneck to safely deploying vastly more computation in the world?
Code has bugs.  AI-enabled attackers will increase the volume and velocity of attacks on software infrastructure. Human code review will not scale.
AIs are untrusted generators. In order to deploy AIs in critical systems without fully understanding their generalization behavior, we‚Äôll need robust, scalable methods for overseeing their solutions.
OPPORTUNITY
Programming languages and formal methods is the promise that we can bootstrap roots of trust. Even as complexity of software goes up, we can design simple interfaces for steering with leverage.
Previously, this technology was only applied to the most mission-critical infrastructure, because of the enormous labor bottleneck ‚Äî requiring years of PhD level engineering work. For instance, Jason worked on the project that wrote the code generator powering trillions of secure https connections everyday, but it took fifteen man-years to complete!
With advances in AI, we‚Äôre able to speed this development cycle 10,000 times! As a wild example of what‚Äôs possible, we spent two hours finding what would have been a zero-day in https code from 2011.
OUR APPROACH
We want to build workflows for trustworthy-by-default programming by pushing our best ideas till they break. The current candidate to beat is program equivalence driven development. You oversee a simple reference implementation. We give you an optimized implementation, along with a proof that the programs are functionally equivalent.
We‚Äôre gradually rolling out our programming environment and models. Some use cases from our customers:
Performance optimization: finding edge cases where hyper-optimized GPU code would fail; getting clear documentation of dependencies that modify behavior in unforeseen ways.
Code migration: automating legacy code refactors from Python to Rust while proving no functional change; writing custom kernels to support new services.
If you work in public infrastructure, finance, hardware, or have other use cases that demand correctness, we‚Äôd love to help. Please reach out at founders@theoremlabs.com",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/theorem-2

We‚Äôre Yonas & Daniel - Co-founders of StarSling.
StarSling (https://starsling.dev) is a developer portal that turns your daily unplanned work from all your dev tools into one-click actions, powered by AI. Open your homepage, click on a GitHub, Linear, or Sentry issue and you‚Äôll see an Autofix button that triggers an agent and opens a Pull Request with a fix, all without leaving your portal. It‚Äôs AI agents for the tasks that live outside of your code editor, across deployments, performance, incidents, and bugs.
https://youtu.be/-rbrSNyguHY 
üåÑ Our Story
Daniel led an engineering team at Netflix that built their Internal Developer Portal (IDP), called Netflix Console. It was the central hub for Netflix's 3,000+ engineers, managers and leaders and became the highest DAU internal tool for developers at Netflix.
Yonas built StackShare, one of the largest online developer communities that had over 1.5M registered developers and an enterprise offering used by thousands of companies that integrated tech stack data into their IDPs and other internal tools.
Both of us have seen the challenges that developers at large companies face in keeping their tech stacks healthy across thousands of codebases. We‚Äôve also seen the benefits that a high-quality single IDP brings to engineering teams. We believe that AI agents have created a unique opportunity for developers to get the benefits of an IDP with automation baked in from the start.
üî• The Problem
Developers typically spend ~20% of their time on annoying eng tasks outside of their code editor:
Fixing exceptions
Patching flaky CI builds and tests
Updating engineering docs and changelogs
Investigating and remediating incidents
Optimizing slow database queries
Debugging preview and staging environments
Rotating expiring credentials and keys
These tasks are spread out across many different developer tools and workflows: Sentry, GitHub, CircleCI, PagerDuty, Supabase, Vercel and many more. StarSling is unifying these tools and bringing AI agents to the rest of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
üßØ Our Solution
We're building a system of AI agents that perform engineering tasks using the deep context that only exists in an internal developer portal (IDP). One central command center that houses internal services, applications, APIs, documentation and has AI agents continuously improving them. We bring your tools into one system and give you powerful workflows by orchestrating AI agents across these tools.
Our first offering is an agentic developer homepage that shows you your aggregated task list along with actions that AIs can take on your behalf. In your homepage you‚Äôll see: your open PRs, exceptions, tickets, notifications, and more alongside AI agents.
Soon StarSling will orchestrate agents across the more complex tasks like investigating incidents. Our immediate goal is to be the interface and ‚Äúportal‚Äù to all the AI agents for the dev tools you already use.
üîÆ Our Vision
To create a system of AI agents that allows every engineer to spend close to 0% of their time dealing with deployments, performance, incidents, and bugs.

Off-the-shelf software forces you into one-size-fits-none flows that never match your actual process
Internal tool requests sit unaddressed in engineering backlogs for months
Most ‚Äúno-code‚Äù tools still require complex code scripts and hours of drag-and-drop work
You pay for 100 generic features to get the one you actually need

Lumari‚Äôs Solution ‚ú®
Lumari empowers anyone to launch enterprise-ready internal apps with no code and no unnecessary SaaS spend.
Describe your desired features, workflow, or task in plain English
Lumari generates the UI, backend logic, and multi-step agentic flows
We instantly connect your apps with deep integrations to your existing tools (CRM, Slack, docs, databases, etc)
Internally deploy your scalable, secure app or agent without any engineering setup
Teams use Lumari for deal-scoring alerts, call-coaching insights, contract to billing pipelines, customer-health dashboards, and a lot more.
The Team
Sam Lamba is an ex-Google engineering lead who led the development of AI-driven features in Google Meet that scaled to millions of weekly enterprise users, and has received 2 AI patents. Sam also previously worked at Uber and Tesla and holds a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science from Duke University.
Eshani Mehta was previously at Stripe leading payments intelligence products handling $XXX million in volume. She also previously worked at Robinhood and Snap and studied Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
Sam and Eshani saw this exact bottleneck firsthand. At Google and Stripe, engineering teams had access to powerful, well-supported internal tools‚Ä¶ because entire teams were dedicated to building them. But GTM teams weren‚Äôt as lucky. Internal requests from sales, ops, or customer teams often sat in backlogs for months, forcing teams to buy rigid tools that didn‚Äôt really fit their workflows. They started Lumari to fix that and give non-technical teams that same level of internal tooling power.

We‚Äôre Dmitry, Sergey, and Alex ‚Äî co-founders of WorkDone.
TL;DR:
Every year, 250 million insurance claims ‚Äî worth billions of dollars ‚Äî are denied due to documentation errors. Many are never recovered. We connect directly to hospital EHRs, monitor clinical staff activity logs in real time, and use AI agents to detect and fix compliance issues before they become risks. Since the beginning of YC, we‚Äôve reached $54k ARR and have a growing number of commercial pilots with hospitals and clinics across the U.S. and PoCs with healthcare enterprises.

Problem:
One small documentation mistake ‚Äî like recording a medication time incorrectly ‚Äî can destroy a family‚Äôs finances.
These errors are often made by exhausted clinicians after 12-hour shifts and are caught by automated insurance systems that instantly deny the claim.
Hospitals don‚Äôt discover the problem until it's too late ‚Äî after the claim is denied, the audit triggered, or the reputation damaged.
Documentation errors are the invisible threat in modern healthcare. They‚Äôre not caused by negligence, but by broken systems: cluttered interfaces, overworked staff, and legacy EHRs that make it easy to click the wrong time, forget a discharge note, or miss a required signature.
And it‚Äôs not just claims ‚Äî these small errors lead to failed audits, regulatory fines, delayed discharges, and increased burnout.
Hospitals end up with compliance teams that are reactive ‚Äî chasing mistakes days or weeks after they happened, often without resolution. The cost isn‚Äôt just money. It‚Äôs morale, trust, and patient safety.
Solution:
WorkDone is an AI compliance autopilot that prevents small documentation errors from becoming costly disasters in real time.
We integrate directly with hospital EHRs, monitor clinical activity in real time, and use AI agents to detect and fix issues ‚Äî like missed discharge notes or wrong medication times ‚Äî before they trigger claim denials or audits.
When a problem is found, our AI opens a quick conversation with the responsible staff member to confirm and correct it immediately.
We don‚Äôt just alert. We resolve ‚Äî and help hospitals run smoother, reduce pressure on teams, and recover revenue that would otherwise be lost.

We're building fully autonomous AI security agents that find, validate, and patch vulnerabilities in web applications and networks at machine speed and scale.
https://youtu.be/Oe-errlwaow
üî• The Problem
Security is fundamentally broken for most engineering teams today:
Scanners are unreliable - They flood engineers with 30-50% false positives, wasting precious development time
Traditional pen testing is too slow - It happens quarterly at best, costs a fortune, and takes weeks to complete
AI-accelerated development creates new risks - Teams are shipping code faster than ever, but security reviews have become an even bigger bottleneck
The result? Companies are forced to choose between shipping fast or shipping secure. Engineering teams lose ~20% of their time dealing with security issues or slowing down to accommodate outdated security practices.
üöÄ Our Solution
MindFort.ai's autonomous security agents work 24/7/365 to find, validate, and patch vulnerabilities:
Find complex vulnerabilities like a human tester would
Validate every finding to eliminate false positives
Patch with intelligent fixes that integrate directly with your codebase
Scale to thousands of tests in an instant, giving coverage never possible before
Unlike solutions that slow development, MindFort accelerates it by eliminating security bottlenecks. Our platform is already finding vulnerabilities in production systems that other tools miss, identifying issues in bug bounty programs, and scoring high on human penetration testing benchmarks.
üí° Our Story
Brandon worked as a PM at ProjectDiscovery, a security scanner company where he led development of the Nuclei cloud platform from an open source tool to an enterprise ready product. He then joined NetSPI, one of the world‚Äôs largest penetration testing firms, to build generative AI tools for human testers. He sat with countless customers across both companies, learning about their struggles in securing attack surfaces at scale.
Akul received his masters in computer science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and was drawn to AI and security early on in his academic career. He co-authored multiple papers on using LLMs to perform various cybersecurity attacks, worked on creating novel benchmarks for hacking agents, and participated in red teaming and model safety programs at both OpenAI and Anthropic.
Sam worked as a senior engineer at Salesforce, where he led security for a large business unit, Tableau. During his time there, he worked first hand on keeping a large scale product secure. Between juggling security assessments, validating findings, and managing remediations inside of a large organization, he had seen it all. He began experimenting with ways to use AI to help solve some of the issues he faced at Salesforce and even worked on a demo of a tool to perform agentic code review through a DARPA program. He recently completed a master‚Äôs degree in cybersecurity at UC Berkeley.
We all met through our work and research. Early on, we all realized that the future of security was going to belong to AI agents, and that the coming tidal wave of new code generated with AI would need a solution of equal magnitude.
üîÆ Our Vision
Security should accelerate your business, not slow it down. We're creating a world where security testing happens continuously and vulnerabilities are patched autonomously, keeping your product and your users safe, while letting you ship faster.

Every time a home is sold, refinanced, or undergoes any transaction, multiple parties, including the government, use appraisals. This is a tedious process, as anyone who‚Äôs had an appraisal done knows. It can take days end-to-end and weeks to turn around. It will only get worse when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac enforce longer reports and more detail come September, blowing up the appraisal industry. Not with ValueMate.

ValueMate completely transformed our workflow ‚Äî I honestly can‚Äôt believe how much faster we‚Äôre working. No more wasted hours on templates, data entry, or switching between tools. It‚Äôs unreal.

We are building microfactories that can handle the upcoming wave of AI-designed drugs and safeguard against biothreats.
Launch Video
THE PROBLEM
America is at risk of ceding leadership in advanced biomanufacturing to China.
Drug manufacturing is moving to China; 79% of US biotech and pharma companies already have at least one contract with a Chinese firm, primarily because they are faster.
China is investing billions in biotech; one third of new compounds licensed by US pharma are now discovered and manufactured in China, up from almost none five years ago.
Over-reliance on foreign biomanufacturing is a national-security risk; agile, on-shore manufacturing is critical to protect our nation against future biothreats.
OUR SOLUTION
A contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) for advanced drugs, rebuilt from the ground up to address the future of America‚Äôs biomanufacturing needs.
Faster biomanufacturing; Our platform leverages advanced methods to accelerate production timelines and de-risk scale-up.
Modular container factories; our form factor is a standard shipping container that can be brought up to operation in roughly two weeks and shipped where it is needed.
Supply-chain independence; by vertically integrating and manufacturing critical equipment in-house, we secure production against global disruptions.
WHY IT MATTERS
Drugs can be developed faster; shorter production cycles move life-saving drugs from the lab to the clinic up to a year sooner.
More drugs can be developed; we will be able to manufacture the thousands of low-volume, personalized biologics that will be designed by AI.
Strengthening US autonomy; rapid-deploy, U.S.-based capacity protects the nation from supply shocks, geopolitical turbulence, and potential bioweapons.
WHO WE ARE
We love biomanufacturing. Together, we built Protein Evolution, an industrial biotech company that turned plastic waste into new textile fibers. Scott is ex-McKinsey and a Yale mathematician (he loves a good cost model almost as much as he loves America). Mike earned his PhD in Bioengineering from Penn after completing Penn‚Äôs M&T program in undergrad (he builds DNA, software, and bioreactors).

We are Hans and Hardik - longtime friends and co-founders of Boost Robotics.
TL;DR
Boost Robotics builds autonomous mobile manipulation robots that can inspect and physically interact with data center infrastructure.
Instead of dispatching technicians for every cable check, reboot, or hardware swap, data centers can now triage and resolve issues through ‚Äúrobot remote hands‚Äù. When not performing interventions, the robots continuously provide 24/7 security monitoring and operational analytics.

üö® The Problem
As AI infrastructure continues to scale up, data center physical operations are becoming increasingly difficult:
Growth bottleneck: AI demand is scaling faster than the operational capacity to support it.
Increasingly Remote Locations: Data centers are being built near cheaper power sources in sparsely populated areas‚Äîoften with limited access to skilled labor.
Competition: Hyperscalers are looking for every possible edge. Downtime means SLA violations and lost revenue.
Hazardous Environments: Maintenance involves high-voltage power and toxic liquid coolants.
Now more than ever, robots are gaining the dexterity and generality to solve these critical problems.
ü§ñ The Solution
We are building a general purpose robot to handle a variety of use cases in data centers.
Predict, find, and solve issues faster, even when you‚Äôre not physically on-site.
Enable one skilled technician to debug multiple issues across multiple sites through context-aware teleoperation, and eventually autonomy.
Provide 24/7 security monitoring and inventory management, simplifying compliance and financial audits while collecting data for your data center digital twin models.

üë• The Team
We met as engineering school freshmen at Carnegie Mellon University in 2015, when we both joined the same competitive Bhangra dance team. Over the next 10 years, we lived together, worked together in school projects, and both received Master‚Äôs degrees from CMU‚Äôs Robotics Institute. We always knew we would start a company together.
Hardik was previously robotics team lead at an agtech startup where he pivoted the team to a new product and made sales within 1 month. He was selected as commencement speaker for the CMU School of Computer Science Masters ceremony by his professors in recognition of his leadership.
Hans was previously a Staff Software Engineer at Boston Dynamics, where he worked on productizing computer vision algorithms for the Spot inspection robot. Before that, he built GPS-denied drone autonomy at a startup and conducted legged robotics research at CMU‚Äôs Robotics Institute.
Our Ask
We're actively seeking forward-thinking data centers to pilot our autonomous robotics platform at their facilities.

Chad Rigetti is in second-time founder mode with Sygaldry, having built quantum computing company Rigetti Computing from YC S14 to a public company (NASDAQ: RGTI). Idalia Friedson, former Chief Strategy Officer at Strangeworks, helped Chad take Rigetti public in 2022 after starting the world‚Äôs first quantum policy center at the Hudson Institute.
Why Sygaldry?
Sygaldry‚Äôs quantum-accelerated AI servers will allow companies to innovate more quickly, improve margins, and deploy better AI products by providing speedups at a fraction of the cost and energy of GPUs alone.
https://youtu.be/X7NxwNPHpQM
The Problem:
AI progress demands more chips, more power, and more data centers‚Äîa trajectory that is physically and environmentally unsustainable with purely classical infrastructure.
The Solution:
Augment classical infrastructure with quantum processors built for AI, since quantum can provide exponential speedups for specific AI tasks. Sygaldry is building quantum-accelerated AI servers to speed up training and inference and creating tools for AI researchers to integrate quantum capabilities into AI models and workflows.
The Impact:
Reduce the time between model releases
Fine-tune existing models faster
Enable faster token generation for distributed LLMs
Unlock faster inference for diffusion models
Conduct greater exploration in novel model architecture
Leverage secure quantum communication channels
Increase AI affordability, accessibility, and personalization
Sygaldry‚Äôs Unique Approach:
Most quantum computers are built using one type of quantum bit, but each qubit has distinct strengths and weaknesses. Sygaldry AI servers combine multiple qubit types within a single, fault-tolerant architecture to leverage their strengths, while avoiding their limitations. This is the same way classical computers are made. We believe this approach to quantum will seem obvious in retrospect.

We turn Microsoft Word into an IDE for contracts, and build agents operating in the background. Our initial focus is on Transactional Law Firms, and agents built for quality-assuring projects and documents according to the firm‚Äôs best practice.
We have already rolled out Vesence firm-wide at our first enterprise client with a lot of love from both associates and partners.
Know any Transactional Lawyers? Let‚Äôs connect: founders@vesence.com.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr1Q7S6A84I
Problem:
Imagine programming in Apple Notes.
No linting, no cursor, you are on your own.
That is how it is for many lawyers to draft and review contracts in Microsoft Word.
At law firms, the stakes are extremely high. Every mistake can hurt your reputation badly. Associates need to deliver under time pressure, partners demand extreme attention to detail, and your clients will not accept any blunders.
Given the attention to detail needed in the work, working on complex projects under constant time pressure, we are starting with quality-assuring agents (i.e. a linting system for contracts).
The consequences of shipping ""bugs"" in a legal document can be catastrophic, but even the best firm still rely on manual review to catch mistakes.
What We‚Äôve Built
Vesence offers quality assurance AI agents available straight in Microsoft Word to handle tasks such as:
Apply firm-wide Standards: Apply writing style guides and best practices consistently across all practice groups in the firm
Ensure project-level alignment: Flag inconsistencies across multiple deal documents, for example auto-checking the SPA against the original term sheet
Verify document consistency: Catch defined term slips, bad cross-references, logical gaps, and miscalculations within a single document
Why This Matters
Let‚Äôs hear it from our users:
‚ÄúYou saved me 4 hours last night.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm never sending out a document/project again unless I‚Äôve used Vesence.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is how AI should feel like. Intuitive and extremely helpful.‚Äù
Associates love Vesence as they can produce exceptional internal deliveries under less pressure to seniors and partners. Partners love the tool as their teams hand them better quality work and follows the firm‚Äôs best practices.
The interest we have seen from transactional law firms is great, but we also received inbound from other professional service providers that care deeply about quality and the reputation of their firms, including Investment Banks and Management Consultants.
Basically, the holy trinity of where the ‚Äòpls fix‚Äô culture thrives.
Who We Are
The founders Henrik Hansson and Ludvig Swanstr√∂m have known each other for 8 years, and worked together at the YC startup Depict S20 (founded by the CEO and Founder of Lovable).
To build Vesence, we spent a couple of months living at a law firm, to refine the product and user experience alongside lawyers.
We have already rolled out the product firm-wide at a law firm.

We're Alex, Land, and Rajit - co-founders of Prism.
TL;DR:
Prism is an AI that watches session replays and tells developers what to fix.
https://youtu.be/xmvlRom8BNA
Problem
At Rajit‚Äôs previous company, they built a new onboarding flow, set up a dashboard to analyze it, and realized that it was broken. The problem was that this realization came four months later.
This is the core insight that led us to start Prism.
Existing product analytics solutions are inflexible. They require comprehensive instrumentation and break every time an engineer adds a new flow or modifies an existing one.
With Prism, developers get insight into what's broken on day one. No event-tracking necessary.
Solution
Prism uses vision models to watch session replays and identify friction. For our customers, it's like having a support engineer sit with every one of their users.
People get value from Prism in one of two ways.
1. SEMANTIC SEARCH
Rather than watching hundreds of hours of session replays, developers can ask ‚Äúwhat are the main pain points users are experiencing?‚Äù
2. INSIGHT GENERATION
Prism identifies what the issue is, who‚Äôs experiencing it, and what a developer can do to resolve it.
One more thing...
While building software may be increasingly commoditized, we believe that the relationship people have with their users will never be. Prism is an AI that enables our customers to know their users better than they know themselves.

They get stuck in loops, repeating mistakes and requiring constant human guidance in the right direction. Your prompts get longer and longer as you try to hard-code solutions.
Even when your agent successfully completes a task, this long process starts all over again for any future run. Starting a new Cursor chat or Operator session means losing all of the insights and ‚Äúaha moments‚Äù your agent had.
Learning is fundamentally iterative, but agents can‚Äôt learn because they have no memory across runs.
HOW THETA WORKS
Theta is building the infrastructure for agents to self-learn and adapt in real-time. The first component is an intelligent memory layer that learns from your agent‚Äôs previous runs. Just add four lines of code to your agent stack to get started:
At the end of the current run, Theta generates and embeds an analysis of your agent‚Äôs trajectory. It identifies critical steps and assesses overall performance.
Before the next run, Theta generates a detailed plan based on the specified task. It gathers relevant insights and optimizations based on previous runs.
With real-time learning, the memory layer continues to improve with more runs‚Äîmeaning your agent gets better and better with zero human intervention.
Using this memory layer, we were able to improve the accuracy of OpenAI Operator by 43%. With optimized trajectories, Operator also took 7x fewer steps, resulting in better speed and cost.

TL;DR
Problem: Knowledge workers spend a lot of their time searching complex documentation with diagrams, tables, or spreadsheets, just to find relevant information. Text‚Äëonly RAG misses details, hallucinates, and provides half-baked responses.
Solution: Morphik embeds whole pages (image‚ÄØ+‚ÄØtext, no OCR), auto‚Äëbuilds a knowledge graph, and serves it through a UI, SDK, or REST API. We have 90‚ÄØ% accuracy on arXiv QA (and we can fine-tune for your use case üôÇ).
Watch our demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3adZQhm5JZY
PROBLEM
RAG breaks the moment documents stop being blobs of text.
Knowledge workers spend a lot of their time (people we spoke with said 50-70% time just in the research phase). eg. electrical engineers finding perfect PCB spec, pharma companies trying to search ELNs for similar experiments.
80% of enterprise knowledge lives in diagrams, tables, images, CAD, scanned pdfs, not .txt.
‚ÄúMultimodal‚Äù models still hallucinate or miss key context because the retrieval step sees only text, or they rely on tools to retrieve diagrams, or context. (https://docs.morphik.ai/blogs/gpt-vs-morphik-multimodal)
Teams glue together OCR, vector DBs, and regex‚Äëheavy ETL that becomes a brittle monstrosity.
SOLUTION
Directly embedding and search over page images
When you ingest in Morphik, in addition to OCR, we create direct embeddings for the image of a page (or frames in a video). When you ask ‚ÄúColpali comparison to standard RAG‚Äù, the LLM sees the actual page image, so multimodal models can reason over arrows, labels, scales, and colours just like a human.
RULES ENGINE
When ingesting, you can define rules for data extraction (which would again consider tables, diagrams), or define natural language rules for PII redaction, or content transformation.
DEPLOYMENT READY, SCALABLE
Morphik comes built in with folder scoping, end user scoping, GPU accelerations, and fine grained permissions, so you can prototype and deploy with enterprise grade features. It‚Äôs end‚Äëto‚Äëend, so you don‚Äôt scramble to make duct tape fixes.
ONE MORE THING‚Ä¶MORPHIK RESEARCH AGENT
Our research agent uses Morphik‚Äôs retrieval, graph, and extraction APIs as tools. It chains them automatically, jumping from doc to doc, node to node, seeing figures, till it finds the needle in the haystack, or has enough context to answer your questions. ‚ÄúDescribe the third pin on the USBC21 diagram‚Äù will get the diagram, find the pin, jump to the table with pin descriptions, jump to page 13 to ‚Äúfind more details on page 13‚Äù.

We‚Äôre Derik and Andrew, and we‚Äôre building RunRL: the platform that lets you run reinforcement learning on your AI.
We used to run an AI research lab together, and Andrew dropped out from his RL PhD to provide you the greatest reinforcement learning experience possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPP5YNMA4GE
The problem
For a generic LLM agent, every day is like the first day on the job. Tools and tasks need exhaustive explanations. Even still, agents are too unreliable for deployment.
Our fix
RL fine-tuning produces specialist models that intuitively know what to do. It uses the algorithms that produced DeepSeek R1, but customized for your use case.
Simply give us a reward function that tells us what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs bad‚Äîand we‚Äôll make your model improve.
EXAMPLE 1: CHEMISTRY
You‚Äôre trying to make a model that generates potential drug candidates for COVID. You want them to bind as tightly to the active site of Sars-CoV-2 protease as possible, but using Claude+thinking+web-search only gets you a binding performance of 22. Making a better model is as simple as defining the reward to be the binding performance of the model‚Äôs outputs:
def reward(output):
    molecule = parse_SMILES(output)

    if valid_molecule(output):
    return binding_performance(output)
else:
    return -1
loading it up on RunRL.com, and hitting run:
So, a model 175x smaller than Claude learns to outperform the frontier models!
EXAMPLE 2: AGENTS
You have an OpenAI or Anthropic-based agent, but it‚Äôs not as reliable as you‚Äôd like it to be. Maybe your agent already does what you want most of the time, but isn‚Äôt consistent enough to be trusted in production. RL can help with that too: it reinforces good behavior and makes your agent better at rule-following, information extraction, and document navigation in high-stakes environments. Join our beta here!
Run RL!
If you‚Äôre using AI and you want your model to be better, and you have a way of describing what ‚Äúbetter‚Äù is: you‚Äôre ready to run RL.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/runrl

We unite hundreds of scattered data sources, especially lab instruments, into one central nervous system for the lab.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53OqAmNzEZA
The Problem
Despite pushing the boundaries of chemistry, biology, and materials science, many of the world‚Äôs top research labs still run on outdated tools. Lab instruments dump data into Excel spreadsheets. Scientists email these files to themselves. In some cases, labs shell out for clunky custom databases built by consultants that are rarely maintained, and never integrated with modern analysis tools.
The result? PhDs spend hours cleaning and wrangling data instead of making scientific breakthroughs. Labs operate with fragmented, siloed information, unable to collaborate effectively or scale insights across projects. The friction is so normalized, it's invisible ‚Äî but it's one of the biggest bottlenecks in research today.
What We‚Äôve Built
Labric is a modern data platform purpose-built for scientific labs. We bring your lab into the 21st century, without forcing you to abandon your workflows.
Here‚Äôs how:
Instrument Data Streaming: A lightweight app installed on lab computers streams experiment data into a centralized, structured system.
Data Consolidation: We integrate seamlessly with Notion, Excel, Sheets, and Drive, bringing all your data together in one place.
Web Platform: Access, search, and analyze all your lab‚Äôs data in one unified interface.
With AI integrated at every layer, we‚Äôre unlocking smarter, faster research without sacrificing reproducibility or context. We've already seen how better data infra can lead to more collaboration, better experiments, and more time doing real science.
Why This Matters
AI is transforming how science is done, but only if the data is structured, contextual, and accessible. Without that, teams lose reproducibility, miss key insights, and underuse AI‚Äôs potential. Labric is the missing layer enabling real scientific AI ‚Äî not just hype. We strongly believe this has the potential to 10-100x scientific output per dollar.
Who We Are
Caitlin led data infrastructure at a materials science startup for 4 years, building from the ground up. Connor previously worked on database products at Google. Our team combines deep technical chops with a first-hand understanding of lab chaos.

‚ùå Problem
With AI that‚Äôs so great at math, why can‚Äôt it teach at near-human quality?

Real-time feedback on every stroke (< 300ms) ‚ö°
‚öôÔ∏è How we do it?
With tens of thousands of lines of Python and Wolfram Language code. Writing on an iPad, we convert the stroke data to LaTeX, parse it, ask a million symbolic questions about it with reference to the problem‚Äôs ground truth (the lines with a blue index), and assess whether it is right, wrong or something in between.
We do not rely on the vibes of a language model to assess the details of their working - too slow and unreliable. Many students give up on LLMs for genuine collaboration when they mislead them on topics the student finds difficult.
We can handle a lot of math already.
üí° Core insight
We tried all the AI tutor desktop formulations we could imagine, but beyond the obvious interface challenge, AI is exceptionally poor at spotting the subtle mistakes students often make. LLMs are great at doing correct math, but much worse at pulling out an error within the many lines of messy student reasoning.
We started performing a symbolic analysis of the student‚Äôs working as context for the AI to boost accuracy - but then we realised we could give this straight to the student. This was when we started to feel the magic.

TL;DR
We‚Äôre already helping hundreds of doctors acquire and schedule more patients with our AI voice agents that handle appointments over the phone (how 88% of patients still schedule today!).
Ask: Do you know any eye care doctors or healthcare administrators struggling with their phone calls? Email betty@trapezehealth.com.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ExU-yIiIpg
Problem
61% of patients miss out on essential appointments each year due to scheduling hassles, costing our healthcare system $280B annually.
We‚Äôre starting by tackling where 88% of patient appointments are scheduled and managed today: the phone.
Doctors have a hair-on-fire problem managing their call centers and front desks. They‚Äôre expensive to run and have high turnover rates, which leads to long hold times and high abandonment rates ‚Äî and ultimately lost patients. For example, our customers have the call center as a multi-million dollar annual expense, and are seeing 20%+ abandonment rates.
Solution
To solve this, we‚Äôre building AI voice agents that can be deployed to act as a doctor‚Äôs best scheduler with:
Our scheduling rules engine structuring doctor-specific rules across .pdfs, EHRs, paper, tribal knowledge
AI voice agents that handle intake, insurance verification, and slotting integrated with the EHR and telephony system
Admin portal and dashboard that provides visibility into patient call resolution gaps

You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.

We‚Äôve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don‚Äôt have to tradeoff performance for privacy. 

Under the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA‚Äôs confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil‚Äôs software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like ""trust us, we don‚Äôt log your queries.‚Äù Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user ‚Äî not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it‚Äôs processed on. 

The founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.

As AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable. By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_HjHmprVOs
Auth has been a pain point for many developers in the TypeScript ecosystem for a while. Other open-source libraries require a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication. So, we set out to build a comprehensive auth library - framework-agnostic, with a robust set of features out of the box, a plugin ecosystem for everything else you might need, and great documentation.
Since launching v1 just 5 months ago:
13K+ GitHub stars and 350K+ monthly npm downloads
We've grown into one of the most influential and well-loved open source projects in the TypeScript ecosystem.
Used in production by great teams including YC companies and major OSS projects including folo, same, dokploy, zero, onejs and many more.
We‚Äôre the recommended auth library by Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, and other top JS frameworks.
A thriving community with 5K+ members on Discord, 7K+ followers on X, and a growing ecosystem of adjacent libraries built by community members.
Featured by creators like Theo, Dev Ed and more
To take it further, and after seeing the pain points of our current users, we're building an infrastructure layer on top of the framework to extend the library with functionality we can't offer through the framework alone:
A comprehensive admin dashboard with user management & analytics
Bot/fraud/abuse detection
Global session storage
and more‚Ä¶
To be clear ‚Äì we‚Äôre not building a third-party auth service. Our goal is to make rolling your own auth so ridiculously easy that you‚Äôll never need one.

Existing solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.

I‚Äôm Lev and I invented time travel‚Ä¶ for your database.
‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù
TLDR: PgDog is a proxy for scaling PostgreSQL. It can load balance traffic and shard databases, without changes to app code or using database extensions. What does this have to do with time travel? Keep reading.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trSVJel3gyc
‚ùå The Problem
Scaling Postgres is a full time job. Your app is writing data but the database can‚Äôt keep up. You‚Äôre adding more databases and thinking of breaking the app into services to spread the load.
PgDog is for you if:
You had an outage caused by a bad query
Your database is unpredictable; app latency and uptime are all over the place
You know more about Postgres internals (like vacuum) than you‚Äôd like, and you just want it to work so you can go back to building your product
And you catch yourself day dreaming about the good old days, when you were pre-PMF and your DB was at 10% CPU.
üë∑ The Solution
Database problems should be solved at the database layer. PgDog is a load balancer, connection pooler, bouncer, and sharder. It speaks fluent SQL and understands every single Postgres query. It uses this knowledge to:
Distribute queries between shards, horizontally scaling your relational database
Load balance traffic between replicas
Block or rewrite queries you don‚Äôt like, e.g. queries that forgot an index or are missing the customer_id and were about to leak data
With PgDog, your DB is young again and ready to grow 10x. Written in Rust, for security and performance, PgDog is fully tested and ready for production.
üôè The Ask
If any of this sounds familiar, get in touch! I‚Äôm happy to come work for you to fix your DB. I‚Äôll stay in the basement and make PgDog scale Postgres, while you work on your startup.
You‚Äôre my ideal design partner if:
Postgres is your production database (naturally)

TL;DR
We‚Äôre building an embodied AI platform that lets anyone teach robots new skills ‚Äî just by talking to them. No code. No engineers. No week-long reprogram. Mbodi turns natural language and quick demos into precise, reliable robot actions that run in production in minutes, and adapt as often as you need.
We are now rolling out real-world deployments to customers with a joint commercialization partner, ABB, the world‚Äôs leading robot manufacturer.
https://youtu.be/CwRxP3_F9MA
üö® The Problem
Manufacturing is facing a critical inflection point.
Labor crisis: Labor accounts for nearly half of global GDP ($40+ trillion), but over 70% of factories face severe labor shortages.
Flexibility gap: Traditional robots require week-long reprogramming by engineers or specialists every time things change.
Untapped automation potential: Hundreds of billions of dollars in manufacturing tasks, especially those with high variation, remain out of reach for automation because robots can‚Äôt adapt fast enough.
This mismatch, between inflexible robots and ever-shifting production needs, leaves a massive automation gap across global manufacturing. We simply need robots to be more versatile. It wasn‚Äôt quite possible ‚Äî until now.
üß† How Mbodi AI Helps
Mbodi is an embodied AI platform that makes robots learn like humans, with natural language. So anyone can teach robots new skills by talking to them and execute the learned skills reliably in production, in minutes.
We‚Äôve built a cloud-to-edge system that takes your instructions, understands the environment, makes a plan, and turns it into precise, safe robot actions. All within a second. Our universal agent framework can run across any robotic hardware, coordinating perception, reasoning, planning, and control in real time.

When one robot learns something, the entire fleet does. Individual skills can be reused, repurposed, and adapted instantly ‚Äî across machines, factories, and tasks.
üöÄ What‚Äôs Happening
We‚Äôre moving toward real-world deployments after entering a joint commercialization agreement with ABB Robotics, one of the world‚Äôs leading robot manufacturers, following our win in their global AI Startup Challenge from among hundreds. This represents a first-of-its-kind system in industrial automation.

Musa (left) and Daniel (right) met in high school and we constantly saw our own teachers overworked grading hundreds of papers. We noticed our teacher used Scantron for multiple choice questions, but there was nothing to help her grade written work.
We kept seeing tools that totally missed the mark, shifting the workload from downloading/uploading and copy pasting feedback, so we decided to bring AI into the LMS.
We don‚Äôt replace teachers. We help you, help your students :)
üôè Our ask: If you answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù to any of these, we‚Äôd love your help!
Do you know any teachers who grade a lot of written work?
Can you intro us to any elementary, middle, or high schools?

We‚Äôre Luca and Andrey, the cofounders of Kaelio.
TL;DR: Healthcare organizations are drowning in dashboards they can't act on - or worse, flying blind because they lack the resources. Kaelio unifies clinical, operational, and financial data for hospitals, health systems, and health plans - giving them an AI copilot that answers business-critical questions, flags operational risks, and recommends actions to improve clinical outcomes and financial performance. We‚Äôre currently onboarding our first customers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBqZDSekjbo
The Problem
Healthcare organizations are sitting on a goldmine of data from EHRs, finance, procurement, staffing, and many more systems. But most of it stays locked away in silos: disconnected, messy, and hard to use.
Decision-makers face two constant struggles: they‚Äôre either (1) drowning in dashboards they can‚Äôt tactically act on, or (2) flying blind because they don‚Äôt have the resources to analyze that data.
Simple, but critical questions like:
‚ÄúWhat was our referral leakage rate in March?‚Äù
‚ÄúAre claim denial rates within target thresholds?‚Äù
‚ÄúHow are our readmission rates trending this month?‚Äù
often take days or weeks to answer. Sometimes, they never get answered at all.
This leads to missed financial opportunities, operational inefficiencies, and worse patient outcomes. Hiring teams of analysts is expensive. Waiting for consultants is too slow. Yet the need for fast, reliable insights is greater than ever.
Our Solution
Kaelio acts as a copilot for healthcare decision-makers. Ask questions in plain-English and get answers in seconds. Features:
Unified Data Platform: We connect to clinical, financial, and operational systems to centralize and harmonize data.
Natural Language Interface: Users simply ask ‚ÄúHow much did we spend on contract staff last month?‚Äù and Kaelio delivers the answer immediately.
Proactive Alerts & Recommendations: Kaelio does not wait to be asked. It monitors key metrics and alerts decision-makers before problems escalate.

TL;DR
We turn natural language into lab automation. Scientists type their experiment in English. Our software programs robots to execute it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-jid99QPFA
Problem
The biggest scientific breakthroughs -- think Selman Waksman mining microbes for antibiotics or Akira Yoshino testing early lithium-ion batteries at Sony -- started in labs through painful, manual work. Decades later, discovery still relies on pipetting, weighing, and prepping by hand.
It‚Äôs inefficient, exhausting, and slows down discovery. Automation solutions exist, but are often $$$ or built for specific use cases.
We want to change that.
Our Take
What if you could run an experiment by just typing it out?
That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre building for: automation that‚Äôs usable by everyday scientists.
The Zeon System ü¶æ
We sell a hardware + software system that runs lab experiments using off-the-shelf robotics. Labs receive a ready-to-run automation setup that includes:
Our AI-powered software
2 off-the-shelf robotics arms with mounted depth cameras
How it works:
Scientists describe protocols in plain English
Zeon interprets them, detects lab tools using computer vision, and plans the execution
The system generates and executes robotic code in real-time, adapting to the specific lab environment
What‚Äôs Possible
We are already piloting with labs at UCSF and Stanford to:
Run fluorescence screens for nanoparticles overnight
Automate multichannel pipetting for clinical assays
Dispose of biohazardous waste while researchers sleep
Big Picture
Eventually, we want to enable labs that run themselves. Think self-driving labs on Mars or in the middle of the ocean doing science while humans dream. ü™ê üß™üß¨

TL;DR
HelixDB is an open-source graph-vector database that brings structure to your un-structured data for RAG and AI applications.
ASK: Can you introduce us to people/companies that are working on Graph/Hybrid RAG that could benefit from better performance or less overhead in their development cycles? Contact me at george@helix-db.com
https://youtu.be/V5viTRj2h68
‚ùå The Problem
AI is changing at a rapid rate which is fundamentally changing technology. This new tech needs new infrastructure.
Everyone is trying to build AI applications, which often involve dedicated data retrieval for their specific use case. Building these retrieval systems is hard. Previously, we‚Äôve relied solely on vector databases to retrieve semantic matches on tiny snippets of text data. But, this technology is shifting and is relying more heavily on connected data, which comes with better context.
But building these retrieval systems often involve:
Vector databases
Graph databases
Bespoke middleman/syncing software
These setups are complicated, take a lot of time, engineering expertise, and create huge amounts of overhead which makes maintaining them very time consuming and expensive.
‚úÖ Our Solution
HelixDB integrates semantic meaning (through its vector types) with relationships to other data (graph types), a similar model to how we structure information in our brains.
This makes it the best solution for making AI retrieval engines for agents and LLMs.
How we currently do this:
Seamlessly integrate vector types into your knowledge graph
Type-safe query language that guides developers and agents to write correct queries before they are executed
Extreme speeds outperforming industry leaders by 1-3 orders of magnitude
How we‚Äôre going to make it better:
MCP tools that allow agents to walk the graph themselves, deciding at each step how to traverse the graph based on the schema and available data.
Built-in ingestion pipelines for multi-modal data.
Built-in embedding-models bringing immediate structure to your knowledge graph.

Most treat it as a cost of doing business. Instead of waiting weeks for rejections and appealing claims one by one, Claim Health flags issues in real-time and automates claim corrections and appeals‚Äîbefore revenue is lost.

While working with healthcare providers, we found most denials stem from small, preventable documentation errors.

c/ua is an open-source framework that enables AI agents to control full operating systems within high-performance, lightweight virtual containers. It delivers up to 97% native CPU speed on Apple Silicon and works with any language models: https://github.com/trycua/cua.
https://youtu.be/Ee9qf-13gho
‚öíÔ∏è THE PROBLEM
For Computer-Use AI agents to be genuinely useful, they must interact with your system's native applications. But giving full access to your host device is risky - and not ideal. What if the agent's process gets compromised, or the LLM hallucinates and leaks your data? And practically speaking, do you really want to give up control of your entire machine just so the agent can do its job?
In short: How can AI agents interact with operating systems, desktop applications, and browsers without jeopardizing security or sacrificing performance?
‚≠ê SOLUTION: AN END-TO-END FRAMEWORK
We combined Apple's Virtualization.Framework with an agent-friendly interface to create:
- Lightweight VMs: Run at 97% of native CPU speed on Apple Silicon, giving you near-native performance in a secure, virtualized space.
- Sandboxed Execution: AI agents operate in tightly controlled environments, allowing secure interaction with desktop applications - without risking your host system.
- LLM-Compatible Runtimes: Works out-of-the-box with popular LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source tools like Ollama, LM Studio, and OpenRouter.
And we now support MCP! You can use Claude Desktop or Cursor, as your personal assistant to navigate even notoriously challenging apps like Tableau. Watch the demo to see it in action!
https://youtu.be/NTUVU1aBs3c
‚öôÔ∏è HOW IT WORKS
c/ua brings together three powerful components into one unified framework stack:
1. Lume - Our high-performance Virtualization layer leverages Apple's Virtualization.Framework to spin up macOS or Linux environments.
2. Computer-Use Interface (CUI) - This layer lets any process or AI agent - no matter which framework it's built on (like AutoGen, LangGraph, etc.) - see the screen and interact with Lume VMs just like a human would. It supports actions such as clicking, typing, scrolling, and extracting the visual accessibility tree.
3. Computer-Use Agent (CUA) - Built on top of CUI, this general agent framework runs intelligent workflows within these VMs. It's compatible with popular LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, as well as open-source tools like Ollama, LM Studio, and OpenRouter.
An AI agent built with c/ua operates within a virtual environment to:
- Navigate and interact with any application's interface
- Read screen content and perform keyboard/mouse actions
- Switch between applications and self-debug when needed
- Operate in a secure sandbox with controlled file access
All of this occurs in a fully isolated environment, ensuring your host system, files, and sensitive data remain completely secure - while you continue using your device without interruption.
üñ•Ô∏è WHAT CAN YOU BUILD WITH C/UA?
c/ua lets AI agents use real desktop apps - just like a human. For example:
- CAD Copilot: Modify 3D models in tools like Fusion 360 or FreeCAD.
- Photoshop Assistant: Crop, layer, and export assets via prompt.
- Operator for Tableau: Navigate dashboards and filters with natural language.
- Legacy App Automator: Control apps and websites with no APIs through UI actions.

Spring 2025,Kanava AI,"Your First AI Sales Hire for Wholesale Distributors. Founded in 2025 by Smit Dagli and Vikhyath Mondreti, Kanava AI has 2 employees based in San Francisco, CA, USA.","SALES, SUPPLY-CHAIN, AI, AI-ASSISTANT, INDUSTRIAL",2025.0,2.0,San Francisco,0.0,https://kanava.ai/,,,"Industrial Sales teams are underwater. Here‚Äôs why - and what we‚Äôre doing to fix it.
Hi everyone! We‚Äôre Smit and Vik - the founders of Kanava AI
Problem and Opportunity:
The wholesale distribution industry is massive: $9T+ in annual revenue. 410,000+ businesses. 6 million+ employees.
And yet ‚Äî sales teams are drowning.
A third of the workforce is over 55, and replacements aren‚Äôt coming fast enough.
(‚ÄúMost of my sales reps are retiring in the next 2-3 years, I have NO idea what I‚Äôll do after‚Äù - a medium sized electrical goods distributor from Indiana we met)
Reps spend less than 30% of their time selling. The rest? Answering repetitive calls (‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the price of this SKU?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich warehouse has it?‚Äù), digging through systems, and manual follow-ups.
Over 25% of inbound calls never reach a human ‚Äî lost revenue, lost trust, lost time.
This isn‚Äôt just inefficiency. It‚Äôs operational drag at scale ‚Äî and it's only getting worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1NVVxRnLL8
How‚Äôre we solving it:
We‚Äôre building Kanava AI, a voice-based AI agent designed for wholesale distributors.
It handles repetitive tasks like answering stock, price, and order status calls using live ERP data and logging field notes hands-free, drafting follow-ups, updating the CRM all automatically.
It‚Äôs like a junior rep-in-training. It starts with the basics, but improves quickly by learning from the company‚Äôs best performers. Over time, Kanava takes on more:
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Managing consultative sales calls
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Identifying upsell opportunities in real time
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Surfacing coaching insights from rep conversations
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Re-engaging dormant accounts with timely, data-backed outreach
And by the time these reps are ready to retire, Kanava is ready to fill the void they leave.
Most AI tools in this space fail because they try to do too much, too early, and distributors are famously late adopters. We‚Äôre taking a more deliberate path: start with low-leverage work, prove value, and scale responsibility as the system earns it.
Our Team
Vik (CTO) and Smit (CEO) know each other since freshman year of college at UC Berkeley. Both of us studied CS, and worked as AI engineers at various startups before deciding to build our own thing and join YC.
Smit: Built incident resolution agents at a series B observability startup called Observe. Previously worked at Abnormal Security and Salesforce.
Vik: Built voice agents for numerical data entry and hands-free navigation for a data management platform called Uncountable. Previously worked at Uber and Amazon.
We‚Äôre both outsiders to the wholesale distribution industry, but we‚Äôre listening hard and learning fast.
What made us really want to work together was being on the same ultimate frisbee team in the senior year of college - that team was a disaster, we lost every single game we played by huge margins, but despite that, we had a ton of fun and stuck together!

It‚Äôs a question most people don‚Äôt want to ever have to answer.
But for the first time since WW2, democracy is under direct attack.
Defense companies can make billions selling theoretical solutions, but once sh** hits the fan and missiles are landing ten kilometers from your apartment, you‚Äôre going to want what works. Quickly.
So we dropped out of Caltech and went to Ukraine to figure out what really worked. Amidst Russian shaheds striking in the distance and Kyiv‚Äôs air defenses lighting up the sky, we met with soldiers, hackers, and engineers. Their striking kindness and hospitality in the face of total mobilization and a ceaseless stream of air raid sirens was indescribable. The invasion wasn‚Äôt just war, but industrialized hatred.

It turns out war is hacking. Drones and robots ‚Äì code ‚Äì now dictate the battlefield. Gear from big name U.S. defense tech becomes obsolete in a month. The pipeline from R&D to testing to the battlefield is too slow for a real war.

So we‚Äôre making a new defense company, one which leads from the front. Literally. Our first product, PALLAS, will resolve ad-hoc drone software standards and replace the FPV operator with a drone commander‚Äìallowing them to pilot thousands of devices at once instead of just one. Handcrafted from combat user feedback, it will be optimized for victory ‚Äì not ticking boxes in a contract.

https://youtu.be/98mpuz-Z9TM
PROBLEM
Healthcare providers are saddled with a staggering amount of repetitive data entry and triage tasks. Idiosyncratic processes and poor integration plague software platforms in healthcare. Most SaaS tools fail to reduce administrative workload, forcing providers to use human labor for robotic tasks.
As early employees at Forward, we relied on thousands of remote operations contractors to deliver primary care across the US. We‚Äôve seen firsthand how painful it is to have critical processes like patient onboarding bottlenecked on hiring, training, and managing a workforce.
SOLUTION
BitBoard is like hiring a remote contractor that quietly handles your workflow in the background, is always available, and handles any volume of work. There‚Äôs no new interface to learn - our agents work directly inside customers‚Äô existing tools and systems. Our customers just show us how the task gets done, stop doing it, and let an agent take over.
Our agents are already saving customers thousands of hours each year and removing administrative hiring as a blocker for their business.

Vibe coding is dramatically lowering the barrier for non-technical users to create full web apps. Lovable, Replit, Bolt, Google, Canva, Figma all launched their vibe-coding platforms. People love them. They're great for prototyping, but it's difficult to roll out inside a company for internal use cases for those reasons: 

1. Data: If you want to connect your existing data (e.g. Salesforce, Gmail, Jira), you'd need to rebuild the API auth, pagination, etc. 

2. SSO: If you build 20 apps, you'll have 20 different logins

3. Security: AI-built apps have massive risk of exposing data, especially if built by non developers

https://youtu.be/CwNX0aU9MsE
ü§î 1. Problem
Lots of great use cases for ML models in businesses never materialize because ML projects are messy and convoluted. You spend months finding the data, cleaning it, experimenting with models and deploying them to production, only to find out that the project has been binned due to taking so long. At a previous employer, we witnessed a team of 10 ML engineers spend 2 years and $3M building models for a project that never saw the light of day.
There are several tools for ‚Äúautomating‚Äù ML, but it still takes teams of ML experts to actually productionize something of value. And we can‚Äôt keep throwing LLMs at every ML problem. Why use a generic 10B parameter language model, if a logistic regression trained on your data could do the job better?
‚úÖ 2. Solution
Step 1: Connect your data sources
Step 2: Describe your problem statement
Step 3: Use the deployed model via API
https://youtu.be/zByvH0wTSuE
üöÄ 3. How does it work?
Plexe uses a self-correcting team of ML engineering agents to research, experiment, evaluate, refine, and deploy the best performing model over an API endpoint. It connects to data sources, discovering relevant fields, and autonomously building the model. Think of it like your own ML helper helping you go from idea to deployed models 10x faster.

The Team
We met at Cambridge studying Maths in 2016, and the rest is history. Working as Quants and Engineers at Tower Research and Citadel before YC, we spent a year trying to figure out why crypto exchanges can solve all of the above, but traditional exchanges can‚Äôt. We still haven‚Äôt found a convincing answer.
PS - For the Crypto/ Finance Bros
Taking a leaf out of the crypto world, QFEX is listing Perpetual Futures in traditional assets, making it the first exchange to do so. Futures haven‚Äôt changed since the first standardized contract was made in 1865 to help farmers hedge their corn harvests. Now S&P500 futures trade $500 billion daily, but it still expires in time for the harvest. Why?

Furniture stores, specifically rent-to-own furniture stores, write their own contracts regarding rental agreements. This gives them a unique advantage: they can rent to anyone, regardless of credit score.

However, this market has one major flaw: Customers are always late with payments. The stores know about this, and it is just a fact of the business model, but these constant late payments cause a few key operational issues:
Staff Overhead: Stores have to have multiple people on staff dedicated to calling people about their late payments.
Poor Call Execution: Those employees who have to call late payments often miss their call quota, may not talk professionally to the customers, and forget to do compliance checks like mentioning that they are calling on a recorded line. This can mean 5 figures of lost revenue per store per week.
Lost Inventory: Stores lose ~2% of their inventory each year to customers who stop paying. This is mid 5-figures in lost inventory each year per store.
The Solution:

AI Voice Agent that calls, negotiates, and gets payments from customers. It will always try to work out something with the customer so they aren‚Äôt sent to collections, their credit isn‚Äôt hurt, and the store keeps its reputation intact.
Key Features:

Optimizes call time and day to improve conversion
Finds updated contact info (customers often change numbers or addresses)

Problem
‚ÄúFor the past 50 years, semiconductor-technology development has felt like walking inside a tunnel. The road ahead was clear, as there was a well-defined path. And everyone knew what needed to be done: shrink the transistor. Now, we have reached the end of the tunnel.""
H.-S. Philip Wong, Chief Scientist, TSMC, 2024.
Today‚Äôs 2D lithography has hit a fundamental wall in feature density, so the semiconductor industry has begun stacking 2D layers to fit more transistors, bits, and bandwidth on each chip.

But stacking scales cost exponentially with density, unlike the constant cost days of Moore: a 10-layer high bandwidth memory (HBM) package is ~5x more expensive than the same amount of un-stacked DRAM.
Solution
Using a 3D process to make today's increasingly 3D integrated circuits could shortcut this problem, scaling process complexity with materials rather than layers and enabling the next decade of continued progress.
Our 3D lithography technology can do this: it is capable of fabricating multi-material 3D structures with 100 nm resolution at wafer scale.
Where the ability to create more complex forms enables more complex functions, such granular control of matter enables the future of much more than just chips, including biotech, sensing, and advanced materials.
We recently crossed the cost thresholds that make this technology commercially viable. We are currently in conversation with customers, and will be driving an exponential scaling law in the production capacity of this technology over the coming decade.

What we‚Äôve achieved so far
Set up our manufacturing facility and lab in Mountain View, CA.
Built our first 3D nano-printer.
Acquired our first customers, including an LOI for co-development with NVIDIA.
What‚Äôs next
Sell our first products (this year).
Exponentially scale production volume.

Leeroo delivers trainable AI agents that learn much like human colleagues‚Äî from knowledge bases, human feedback, and even their own past experiences. That continuous learning bridges the gap between generic AI and the expert performance companies need. We‚Äôre starting with agents for data- and AI-teams.
https://youtu.be/ONHTKTB7Dik
‚ùå PROBLEM
AI agents look impressive, but for specialized work they remain semi-experts‚Äîand you can‚Äôt effectively train them into experts. General-purpose agents can‚Äôt learn from their own experience, human guidance, or domain-specific materials, so they quickly plateau at basic capabilities. Data and AI tasks demand deep specialization that off-the-shelf agents simply don‚Äôt reach.
‚úÖ OUR SOLUTION
Scaling pre-training to squeeze out marginally better foundation models has flat-lined. The real moat isn‚Äôt building demo agents, it‚Äôs training that agent to expert level on your private context. While agent scaffolding is commoditising fast, Leeroo‚Äôs on-prem, continuous-learning engine transforms your data, workflows, and tacit know-how into a compounding strategic asset‚Äîwithout leaving your VPC.
What Makes Leeroo different
Continuous Learning Loop: Every interaction becomes training data. Agents digest codebases, docs, videos, self-discovery experiences, and your real-time feedback, then consolidate the lot overnight‚Äîso yesterday‚Äôs lessons fuel tomorrow‚Äôs results.
Domain-Specific Reasoning Library: Symbolic search, specialised code synthesis, and deep data/ML expertise tackle real engineering problems directly, not through brute-force guessing.
Multi-Agent Workforce: Multiple agents collaborating asynchronously on heavy jobs, could run entirely inside your VPC.
Our early customers already see their trained agents as high-value assets‚Äîassets that appreciate as the agents keep mastering more of the organisation‚Äôs knowledge.
TEAM
We‚Äôve worked together for 3 + years on various AI systems. Altogether the team has co-authoring 50 + papers in top AI venues, open-sourcing models downloaded 1.5 million+ times, and earning 3K+ GitHub stars.
Majid ‚Äì Co-founder & CEO
PhD, EPFL (ML). Built and led multiple AI teams, created core technologies and AI-enabled products, published research articles in top-tier venues ‚Äîsome featured in media. He was a staff Scientist at Meta AI, where he co-developed a breakthrough technology called ‚ÄúNeural Databases‚Äù and drove LLM applied research that powered customer-support automations and feed relevance across Meta‚Äôs apps. Before that, he was staff Scientist at LinkedIn AI, led content-understanding, job-profile matching, and economic-graph representation learning. Former VP of Research & Technology at BYJU‚ÄôS; earlier research posts at the University of Geneva and Idiap Research Institute.
Alireza ‚Äì Co-founder & Chief Scientist
With a PhD in CS/AI from EPFL and a proven record across leading labs, he has repeatedly advanced LLM research and deployment: at Meta AI, he built an LLM-driven evaluation pipeline that boosted LLM performance on out-of-domain datasets; at Naverlabs, he compressed a state-of-the-art multilingual machine-translation model by 40x; at the University of Zurich, he introduced ensemble and contrastive decoding techniques that significantly lifted translation accuracy; and at the Idiap Research Institute, he devised methods for encoding structured data in LLMs, enhancing a range of NLP tasks. His open-source releases have collectively surpassed one million downloads on Hugging Face, and the underlying research has produced fifteen papers in top-tier AI conferences.

The accounting profession is facing a massive talent shortage, as graduates choose different professions and the old guard begins to retire. As a result, CPA and tax preparation firms are awash in clientele, but unable to keep up. At many firms, phones go unanswered, clients are ""fired"", and websites are taken down, as the existing workforce tries to handle the grueling 80 hour+ weeks necessary to push through tax season to the April 15th deadline.

We built this because a former colleague who owns her own tax firm asked us to automate her workload, and we quickly realized the massive opportunity. Thomas brings deep domain expertise as the former Head of Product at Keeper (YC W19), where he built tax engine automation systems and an OCR form scanning system that outperformed everything else on the market. At Keeper, he leveraged early access to OpenAI's LLMs (well before ChatGPT) to build systems that automated the entire tax filing process, allowing a tiny team of CPAs to process thousands of returns with near zero busy work. Patrick was the first engineer at FunCraft, shipping multiple mobile games with 1M+ downloads and building scalable shared codebases. We've worked together since 2017, including co-leading multiple teams at Zynga as PM & Tech Lead respectively.

We launched this year in the middle of tax season and quickly processed hundreds of returns, earning thousands in ARR, and since tax season we've been growing customers by >30% month-over-month. We've completely automated over 25% of the return process so far and developed a proprietary vision model that beats incumbent scanning technology by almost 2x on accuracy - jumping from 50% field-level accuracy to 89%, approaching the quality of their expensive human-verified service at 92%.

The opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.

We've built this kind of software before, we've worked together for years (and even lived together), we've built products to $10M ARR before, and we have the grit to outwork anyone in this space.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/magnetic

ABOUT US
We‚Äôre Julian and Glenn, and we‚Äôve built stagewise because we wanted to quickly iterate on app frontends with AI - even if they‚Äôre not just simple prototypes anymore, but real projects.
THE PROBLEM
AI-powered app builders work great - until they don‚Äôt.
Once you move into a production-grade project setup on your local machine, you lose the awesome experience of visually building your apps frontend with simple prompts.
You move from tools like v0 or Lovable to tools like Cursor and Claude Code, but there‚Äôs a catch.
AI code editors are not good at building frontends, because:
‚Üí They don‚Äôt understand your apps user experience
‚Üí They don‚Äôt see your browser content, but only the codebase
‚Üí You have to switch between browser and IDE all the time
THE SOLUTION
With stagewise, we‚Äôve developed an open-source and framework-independent toolbar that brings our frontend coding agent right into your web app on localhost.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
‚Üí You prompt changes by clicking and commenting on elements in your app
‚Üí We automatically collect browser and app metadata
‚Üí The agent makes precise changes to your local codebase
The toolbar has already surpassed 4,800 GitHub-stars ‚≠êÔ∏è and 130,000 downloads üìà
OUR VISION
We believe that the best user experiences are built by iterating fast and putting yourselves in the shoes of your user.
Our product enables teams to do exactly that - and we continue to work on a future, where awesome production-grade user experiences can be built lightning-fast and without coding skills.

Why current tracking methods don‚Äôt work
Most tracking technologies today fail where people actually live and work. Over 90% of human activity happens indoors, yet GPS simply doesn‚Äôt function in enclosed spaces, and beacon systems like BLE or UWB cost upwards of $250,000 per site to install and maintain. Even outdoors, GPS breaks down in forests, dense urban areas, warzones, and remote regions‚Äîanywhere signal is weak, jammed, or obstructed. These limitations make traditional tracking systems expensive, unreliable, and fundamentally incomplete for real-world use.

Okibi is a web app that lets you create AI agents using natural language. You can think of it as Lovable for Agents.
Our ask: try it out @ijustwannabuild.ai, and book a call with us! We‚Äôd love your feedback and what kind of agents you need for your company
https://youtu.be/3cZWA9SAohM
‚ùå The problem and why we care to solve it
The two of us have been building software for over 10 years and working together for the past 7. Actually, This is also our second YC startup together. At our previous company, SigmaOS (S21), where we built the first browser with built-in agents, we ran into a ton of repetitive tasks and had to build many agents for our own product. Automating those tasks was slow and complicated. We often ended up doing things manually or relying on partial solutions like Zapier, Lindy, custom scripts, or hacked-together LLM tools. The agents we did build for our product also eventually became messy and hard to maintain.
Creating AI agents typically requires complex, time-consuming setup, including tool calls, LLM syntax management, multi-agent orchestration, browser use, human in the loop, evals, and hosting deployments.
So, when building agents two primary challenges always come up:
Evals
Architecture and Infrastructure
‚úÖ How Okibi solves it for you
Our web app provides a chat interface and toolkit to easily create AI agents. Just describe your agent in natural language, similar to vibe coding, and our app automatically generates your agent's tool calls, human in the loop, browser use, and runs an initial eval on your agent.
Whether you're building an internal workflow automation to remove repetitive or time consuming tasks, or launching a product with agents, Okibi can help you build it.
We are currently working with 15 YC companies from the current and previous batches to automate tasks like:
Pre-qualify companies with the right person at those companies to sell your product to
Generate invoices and update their invoice trackers based on email and contract
Pre-meeting prep for client or sales lead call
Generate pricing and proposal based on meeting notes and existing contracts

We're starting by helping the ag and mining industry track stockpiles of grain and gravel.

Bulk inventory tracking is broken. Companies either rely on guesstimates or pay for expensive manual surveys which are still off by 20 to 30%. Without accurate numbers, it‚Äôs hard to plan logistics, like how many truckloads are needed. And it creates accounting issues by misreporting inventory value, hurting financial planning and leading to missed opportunities.

We‚Äôve lived this problem, and we know how to solve it. Warren saw it firsthand as a Product Manager at Milk Moovement, a $20M Series A AgTech startup, working closely with feed suppliers and farm managers. Jordan scaled Microsoft Azure‚Äôs largest public API, handling over 700M requests/month, and sold software to a public company. Cole was engineer #3 at Tropic, scaling it from seed to Series B, and later led engineering at an AI startup.

We‚Äôve built an integrated hardware and software platform that‚Äôs now being piloted by some of the largest agriculture and construction companies in North America. As industries demand real-time visibility into the physical world, dScribe AI is positioned to become the system of record for inventory that don‚Äôt fit in traditional boxes and barcodes.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/dscribe-ai

Restaurants lose up to $100,000 per year per location from missed calls, lost orders, and abandoned hold lines. Staff are overwhelmed. IVRs frustrate customers. Call centers are expensive and impersonal.

It‚Äôs 2025. Guests don‚Äôt leave voicemails or wait on hold. They just move on.

Certus is an AI voice agent built for restaurants. It answers every call, 24/7 ‚Äî taking orders, processing deliveries, booking reservations, upselling, and handling complaints in English, Spanish, French and more. Certus is built to manage the phone line end to end, from the customer call to the restaurant tech stack, with zero human intervention required. It currently integrates with industry-leading systems like Toast, Square, Clover, UberEats, DoorDash, and more.

We‚Äôre building the voice layer of the modern restaurant ‚Äî the employee they‚Äôll never fire.

We started Certus because we lived the pain. Gurveer (CEO) grew up answering phones in his family‚Äôs restaurant and helped operate them, growing from 1 to 11 locations in 7 years. Later, he and Adam (CRO) ran a restaurant growth startup to help others increase revenue, but kept watching clients bleed cash because no one picked up the phone. So we built the solution the industry always wished existed.

Until now, this problem was considered unsolvable. But Voice AI has finally crossed the conversational chasm and 72% of consumers now prefer AI over humans as long as it means faster and better service.

More importantly, the market is begging for this. The North American restaurant industry crossed $1 trillion in 2024, and it's projected to hit $1.5 trillion in 2025. Yet over $100 billion is still lost annually to missed calls, human error, and outdated tech. As the market continues to grow, so do the losses!

Our customers say it best:

- ‚ÄúCertus changed my life overnight.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWe were losing the ability to give great in-house service ‚Äî the phone was killing us.‚Äù
- ‚Äú70% of my business comes through the phone. That‚Äôs mine and my 16 staffs livelihood.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúBefore Certus, I used to lose 40 - 60 calls a day‚Ä¶. now my printer just stays printing!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in the business 38 years. I‚Äôve been waiting for this since then.‚Äù

Certus is here to fix the $120B phone problem ‚Äî one call at a time.

And in doing so, we‚Äôre redefining how the restaurant industry communicates forever, starting with the phone line.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/certus-ai

Problem: Motion design is complicated, time-consuming, and expensive
Peter used to build YouTube channels and produced more than 240 videos. He spent thousands of dollars every week hiring motion designers to create infographics, text animations, or map animations.

After talking to 130 video teams, ranging from YouTube channels, marketing agencies, and corporates, we learned:
There is no alternative to After Effects to create professional motion graphics.
Mastering After Effects takes years and watching countless tutorials/courses.
Hence, video teams hire expert motion designers.
And even for expert designers, it can take hours to create seconds of motion design.

‚ùå The Problem:
We‚Äôve all experienced it. You need to change your flight. You try online, with no luck, so your only option is to speak to an agent. But how? You can‚Äôt find the phone number.

We‚Äôre taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI. Since June, 3000+ users have created over 4000 apps on Floot.

Existing AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:
- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app
- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don‚Äôt understand
- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)

The fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.

The result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.

Floot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:
1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.
2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.

Because of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.

We also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.

Our platform integrates directly into existing university systems (SIS, LMS, CRM), learns each institution‚Äôs unique workflows, and deploys specialized AI agents. This dramatically reduces the $735 billion universities spend annually on administrative labor, expands staff capacity without increasing headcount, and improves the student experience.

This hasn't been done before because university workflows require nuanced, autonomous judgment, exactly what agentic AI was designed to solve. Our team uniquely combines deep expertise in higher education, enterprise-scale AI, and regulated enterprise sales.

Sadia previously built Salesforce‚Äôs Education Cloud from scratch, creating the core Student Information System widely used across higher education. She deeply understands university operations and maintains trusted relationships with hundreds of higher-ed CIOs and Provosts.

Danial was one of DoorDash‚Äôs earliest engineers, where he architected and scaled complex systems from zero to billions of transactions, including their search, recommendation, and Voice AI platforms. He knows how to build robust AI solutions that reliably perform at enterprise scale. 

Shahryar was a GM at Airwallex, where he built the entire Americas business from 0 to 1 and drove 11x revenue growth.

We‚Äôre Uv and Jason from Autosana üåä
We‚Äôre building a QA agent that tests mobile apps like a real user. We‚Äôre on a mission to make flaky selector-based test scripts (or worse, manual regression testing) things of the past.
Demo here :)
TL;DR
Cloud-hosted mobile QA agent (iOS and Android)
Natural language ‚Üí simulated user flows
Integrates into CI/CD
Saves 8+ eng. hours per deployment
Problem
Dev Tools Have Evolved ‚Äî QA Tools Haven‚Äôt
Tools like Cursor and Claude Code boost dev speed by 10x, but lack the runtime context to write E2E tests, especially for complex and non-deterministic flows.
The QA Bottleneck
Maintaining traditional end-to-end scripts using frameworks like Appium, Espresso, and XCUITest wastes valuable engineering resources (trust us, we‚Äôve been there).
These tests are tedious to write, brittle, and routinely break with UI changes. Many mobile teams ($100B+ companies included) have abandoned them and rely on manual QA.
Solution
We started Autosana to fix the QA bottleneck and help mobile teams ship faster without fear of breaking things.
Just describe your test flows with natural language, as if you‚Äôre talking to your own in-house QA Engineer. No code, no infra setup, no dependence on flaky element selectors, and no more manual work.
Our agent tests your app like a real user, as part of your CI/CD pipeline or on a schedule, and reports to the team when bugs are found.
Autosana supports both iOS and Android, and is framework-agnostic (we support React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin, you name it‚Ä¶).
Mobile QA shouldn‚Äôt be hard. We‚Äôre on a mission to fix the bottleneck between mobile development and testing.

Running a focus group can cost $20k+ and take 1-2 months to recruit participants, interview them, and analyze the results - Motives AI runs that whole process in 1-2 days.
The problem
Marketing teams thrive on understanding their customers, with large brands spending $100mn/year on consumer research. Today they choose between surveys, which are fast and affordable but shallow, and focus groups or in-depth interviews, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars and take weeks or months.
The solution
We‚Äôve built AI agents that can plan, run, and analyze consumer interviews, giving marketing teams deep qualitative insights in days instead of months.
https://youtu.be/dHFtzfFaRKg
Ask a research question, and get results in hours - here‚Äôs how it works:
Customers chat with our AI agent to describe their research questions or the concepts they need to test, and our AI builds a research plan.
Our AI then recruits relevant people from our global panel network and interviews them over video.
The AI automatically analyzes the interviews and generates a report with actionable insights.
Customers can view specific video highlights and chat with our AI to answer follow-up questions.
Results
Our customers include some of the biggest consumer brands in the US and Europe - check out our case study about how Unilever‚Äôs recent acquisition Wild has been using Motives to test new packaging concepts.

GhostEye offers offensive AI agents that generate sophisticated social engineering campaigns across a multitude of attack vectors. With the growth of AI-enabled impersonation and a lack of enablement within organizations to test your people-level security at scale, we knew it was time to give teams the ability to do exactly that. Have you recently been targeted? Reach out at: founders@ghosteye.ai, let‚Äôs talk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5COEwY09Kc
‚ùå The Problem
Social engineering has become the dominant threat vector, and AI is making it devastatingly effective:
The numbers are alarming:
$12 billion in losses from phishing attacks alone in 2024.
442% growth in vishing (voice phishing) attacks in 2024, driven by voice cloning and AI impersonation tools.
$40 billion in AI-enabled fraud expected in the US by 2027.
72% of organizations report rising cyber risks fueled by AI-driven vishing attacks.
Meanwhile, traditional security training has been proven ineffective:
Recent research from UCSD Health studying 19,789 personnel found that ‚Äústandard, out-of-the-box industry training is not efficacious in preventing users from clicking on emails‚Äù.
An ETH Zurich study of 14,000 employees discovered training actually made things worse ‚Äì employees felt safer and were more likely to fall for phishing attacks.
IBM Research shows 3x click effectiveness for targeted phishing campaigns that add phone calls, yet most training only covers email.
Remember that mandatory training you were required to do last June? How much of it do you still remember? When attackers can clone voices with just three seconds of audio and create personalized social engineering campaigns in minutes, checkbox compliance training isn‚Äôt ineffective ‚Äì it‚Äôs giving organizations false confidence while leaving them completely vulnerable.
‚úÖ Our Solution
GhostEye lets you test your people-level security through customized social engineering campaigns tailored to your teams and the individuals within them. Here‚Äôs how:
Intelligence-Driven Targeting:
We leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to gather publicly available information about your organization, and people within your organization.
Sync with identity providers (Google Workspace, Azure AD, Okta, etc.) to understand employee group exceptions, allowing our agents to comprehend day-to-day workflows.
Build realistic attack scenarios based on actual organizational structure and relationships.
Multi-Vector Attack Chains:
Email ‚Üí Text ‚Üí Call sequences that mirror real-world attack progression.
Chained attacks create urgency and pressure ‚Äì the same psychological tactics attackers employ.
Each simulation adapts based on user responses, just like real attackers would.
Psychology-Based Testing:
We exploit the same cognitive biases real attackers use: authority, urgency, and trust.
Simulations trigger genuine emotional responses that reveal true vulnerability levels.
Unlike traditional training that teaches theory, GhostEye lets you discover how your team actually responds to sophisticated attacks.

üôè Our Ask
Think your human layer is locked down? Unsure?
We‚Äôd love to learn more about your current strategy. Most organizations are surprised by how vulnerable they are to coordinated social engineering attacks ‚Äì even with all traditional safeguards in place.

Near term, we will be launching an agent mode via CLI that can flash, test and debug your hardware in real time.
https://embedder.dev/
THE PROBLEM
Embedded engineering is bottlenecked by repetitive, manual work. Engineers waste countless hours parsing 100+ page datasheets, writing boilerplate I2C/SPI drivers from scratch, and wrestling with scattered documentation just to get a new component working.
The industry‚Äôs tooling is stuck in the past. We‚Äôre forced to wrangle fragmented toolchains and navigate archaic, bloated IDEs. The major silicon vendors (ST, TI, Renesas, NXP) provide IDEs for their own ecosystems, but these tools are notoriously undocumented, unintuitive, and sometimes straight up broken. Because their business is selling silicon, they have little incentive to build the world-class development environment that engineers deserve.
OUR SOLUTION
Today, you can use our web platform to automate component bring-up:
Driver Generation: upload one data sheet, get production-ready C/C++ drivers for STM32, ESP32, Arduino, or Raspberry Pi Pico in seconds. Our AI understands register maps, timing diagrams, and communication protocols.
Datasheet-Aware Agent: chat with an agent that has deep context on your specific components and microcontrollers. It grounds all its responses in manufacturer-provided facts, ensuring accuracy for your hardware configuration.
Interactive Component Viewer: ditch the PDF reader. Our custom UI gives you an interactive, searchable view of your component‚Äôs key information.

Missing after-hours calls alone costs the average dealership $1M annually in lost revenue.

We built Flai to fix this - AI assistants that answer dealership calls 24/7, scheduling test drives, oil changes, or running outbound recall campaigns so no opportunity slips away.

The result: No more missed opportunities, no more losing customers to competitors.

Our founding team has built voice AI products at HappyRobot, scaled infrastructure at Uber for millions of users, and applied data science at Netflix to solve operational challenges.

Drug discovery is slow, and it costs billions of dollars. The bottleneck in early discovery is chemical synthesis. b-12 is building a full stack of AI agents to deliver planning and robotic executions of experiments, in minutes, not months. Our team has developed custom robots for chemistry (Chemspeed), orchestrated AI agents for lab control (EPFL & IBM), and is translating this into a powerful and easy-to-use product.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmf7q-Sie2o
‚ùå The problem:
Drug Discovery is slow:
It takes 10+ years and over $2 billion to discover a new drug.
2 in 10000 compounds make it.
Chemistry execution is very slow.
Experiments take time! Designing good experiments and trial and error in the lab are big factors.
Software for chemists is fragmented:
There are many solutions for many different parts of the pipeline.
Tools are outdated, and integration is largely missing.
Lab robots are underused:
Most lab robots are not accessible to scientists because they are hard to use.
Drag and drop software for multimillion-dollar robotic labs.
Lab automation engineers are hard to find.
Current State:
b-12:
‚úÖ Our Solution:
We are integrating a full stack of Agents to design experiments and write code for the robot that runs these experiments, with the tools and context needed to predict chemically meaningful results, and close the experimental loop.

Key capabilities of our Agents:
Streamline Experiment Planning: Our tools accelerate creation of experimental details based on literature and expert tools, and tailor the output to the user‚Äôs specific needs.
Unified platform: Our platform integrates several agents that are in tight communication and can go from natural language input to robotic execution in minutes.
No coding required - use natural language: With arbitrary input flexibility, we can control the robot the same way you would talk to your lab-mates, including inputs from previous runs, and uploading relevant documents.
Parallel and scalable to any lab: We are vendor agnostic, and integrate with different robotics (Chemspeed, Unchained, Opentrons, etc.) and labs performing experiments manually.
Pilot Program: Our team will work on integrating Agentic solutions tailored to your lab's specific problems, whether you use lab automation or not. We want to speed up molecular discovery.

All modern hardware needs firmware but it‚Äôs expensive, time-consuming and bugs in the field can lead to multi-million dollar recalls. BootLoop is building an AI agent to deliver custom firmware, fully tested on your hardware, in minutes not months. Our team built the firmware for SpaceX‚Äôs Raptor engine from first fire to flight, made brain-computer interfaces at MIT, and is embedding that experience into our agent.
Ask: Are you building hardware or do you know someone who is? Email us at founders@bootloop.ai to be added to our pilot program. See below for details.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBI1fkx5Bss
‚ùå The Problem
All modern hardware needs firmware, but writing firmware is hard. It‚Äôs difficult to debug and tricky to validate and chip datasheets can reach upwards of 3000 pages. On top of that, there‚Äôs a shortage of qualified firmware engineers. As hardware gets more complex, the time and cost to write firmware for it goes up exponentially.
The problems are staggering:
The hardware world is incredibly fractured - over 65 different major manufacturers, producing over 80,000 unique chips, each of which has different software stacks, different frameworks, and different capabilities
Modern hardware requires sophisticated networking stacks, power optimization, and advanced security, driving up complexity
Firmware engineers are hard to find - you can't major in firmware engineering - and even the most attractive engineering companies take up to 6 months to find a qualified engineer
ü§ñ Our Solution
We‚Äôre building an AI agent specifically for firmware and embedded software development, with the context and tooling needed to write low-level code and validate it on hardware in real-time.
Key capabilities of our Agent:
Deep hardware understanding: Ingests your documentation, datasheets, schematics, system diagrams, existing codebases, and more‚Ä¶
Hardware interaction: Talks directly with your boards and test equipment like oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and hardware debuggers
Real testing: Validates code on actual hardware or in simulation
Framework expertise: Writes in your language and style using your preferred embedded frameworks and proprietary libraries
ITAR compliance: The first ITAR-capable coding agent, opening massive aerospace and defense markets
Pilot program: Our team will work with you as forward-deployed engineers on a specific firmware problem. We‚Äôll use our agent internally to deliver aerospace-grade code FAST, with a human validating every line. After the pilot, we‚Äôll deploy your custom version of the BootLoop agent for your future firmware needs.

We‚Äôre Moncef DJAFRI and Mariem Ould Ismail from üá´üá∑ Paris, and we‚Äôre building Stockline.
TL;DR
Stockline is an AI-native ERP for food wholesalers ‚Äî automating manual order entry and replacing their clunky software from the 90s.
WHY WE CARE
Mariem‚Äôs father is a fish wholesaler. üêü Back in high school, she spent her summers helping him ‚Äî and watched him waste hours every day retyping orders, chasing invoices, and drowning in paperwork. ‚úèÔ∏è
That‚Äôs where the idea was born.
Mariem and Moncef met at √âcole Polytechnique in France, where we went through years of military training, rigorous math, and team projects.
We were both admitted to MIT and Stanford, but chose to focus on Stockline‚Äôs mission: bringing tech to an industry long overlooked by digital transformation.
THE PROBLEM
Most food wholesalers still rely on software from the 90s.
One symptom among many: Orders come in through WhatsApp, SMS, email, or phone calls ‚Äî and get retyped manually into their ERP.
Admin work takes over.
Headcount grows just to keep up with repetitive tasks.
From quoting to delivery, everything is manual, error-prone, and slow.
They barely use data. Prices are set by instinct, with no visibility into stock or margins. And most tools out there just don‚Äôt match how they actually work.
This leads to:
‚Üí Mistakes
‚Üí Tight margins
‚Üí Food waste
THE SOLUTION
Stockline replaces outdated ERPs with AI at the core. The game-changer? No more manual data entry.
Our AI captures orders from every channel ‚Äî WhatsApp, SMS, email, even phone calls ‚Äî and feeds them straight into one unified system.
We centralize:
‚Ä¢ Communication (WhatsApp, emails, SMS‚Ä¶)
‚Ä¢ Operations (billing, inventory, CRM‚Ä¶)
All in one platform. Admin disappears.
Once you have all the data in one interface, the sky‚Äôs the limit! And the broader vision is to rethink ERPs entirely so that wholesalers finally get to focus on what really matters:
‚Üí Their products
‚Üí Their customers
‚Üí Their margins

The Problem: Subscription only gets you so far‚Ä¶
Most AI apps today try to monetize with subscriptions, but just can‚Äôt find enough users who are willing to pay.
‚Üí Inference bills are crushing - AI compute costs 10-30x more than traditional apps
‚Üí Subscription gates kill growth - Only 3% of users typically convert
‚Üí Can't scale to billions - Free tiers = bankruptcy

HOW IT WORKS:
One-line integration - Drop in our SDK with an API key
Contextual ads - We subtly include relevant brand mentions in your AI chat
Revenue sharing - Developers get paid per impression or per click
**The Magic:**
If a user asks about luxury stays in Tokyo, Imprezia might insert: ""Park Hyatt Tokyo‚Äù as an in line mention.

**Brand Portal:**
Advertisers can create campaigns and launch across our network of AI apps.

The best GPU engineers work at Nvidia and OpenAI for $2M+ packages. The rest of us are stuck with PyTorch code that uses <50% of our hardware. We built Herdora for every team that can't afford a GPU optimization expert. Herdora takes your PyTorch and optimizes it with custom kernels. It monitors your inference workloads, catches inefficiencies, and fixes them automatically. You keep shipping fast. Herdora makes it run fast. No CUDA knowledge required, no million-dollar hires needed.
Ask: Are you trying to make your inference faster, writing CUDA by hand, or do you know someone who is? Fill our our interest form or send us an email contact@herdora.com to be added to our pilot program. See below for details.

üßô THE PROBLEM
Getting AI models to run fast on GPUs requires a rare breed of engineer.
These GPU wizards:
Command $300k+ base salaries (if you can even find them)
Spend months hand-writing custom kernels for each model
Need to rewrite every kernel for new hardware
Even worse: If you want to run on alternative GPUs or other accelerators, you need different experts to rewrite all your kernels. Most teams are stuck choosing between:
Paying $$$ for GPU talent
Accepting <50% hardware utilization
Locked to one chip longer than they want
‚Äî
üêÑ HOW HERDORA SOLVES IT
Herdora does what those GPU engineering wizards do, automatically. Feed it your PyTorch code, and it generates the optimized kernels that would normally take months of manual work.
What you get:
Auto optimization - Your PyTorch goes in, optimized GPU code comes out. Same model, 1.5 to 5x faster. The kernels Herdora writes are what a senior CUDA engineer would write after weeks of profiling and tuning.
Hardware portability - NVIDIA can‚Äôt give you enough capacity? Want to try out AMD‚Äôs new MI350 series? Herdora makes your code fast on both in seconds. No rewrites, no performance penalties.
Production monitoring - Herdora watches your models in production, spots inefficiencies, and fixes them. Think of it as having a GPU expert on-call 24/7.
You write PyTorch. Herdora makes it run like it was hand-tuned by the best in the business. Herdora then monitors prod to track performance. No CUDA expertise needed on your team.
‚Äî
üì¢ WHO THIS IS FOR
You should reach out if any of this sounds familiar:
You're an ML engineer but you don't have time to learn CUDA
Your cloud bill is killing you because your models only use 30-50% of each GPU
You want to try cheaper GPUs but can't risk your models running slower

‚ùå The problem:
Sales teams waste time and money reaching out to people who aren‚Äôt good fits for their product. How often do you receive a cold email about something you don‚Äôt care about at all?
üöÄ Our solution:
We built custom scraping and crawling infra that finds high-intent prospects by scanning online data sources such as company websites, news articles, job postings, and social media. We specialize in industry-specific data sources - think court dockets for legal tech, building permits for proptech, or freight brokerage listings for logistics.

Think about it like assigning a ‚Äúscore‚Äù to all potential prospects so you spend time focusing on ones that are already likely to buy.
Why
Previously, Kishan ran a growth experiment at Ramp where he noticed that growth doesn‚Äôt come from gimmicky emails, but from finding the right customers at the right time. Vihaar, who sold his first restaurant tech startup at 19, learned the same lesson the hard way: the biggest lever in sales isn‚Äôt what you say - it‚Äôs who you say it to.

This enables rapid deployment and a unique business model where we can let companies pay by-the-hour, instead of requiring massive capex. We already have a biotech unicorn using our robots in production to package delicate chemical vials.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHzjweFnbkk&feature=youtu.be
The Problem: Robots are difficult to deploy & have fixed workflows
Traditional robot arms often require months of custom engineering and planning to integrate. These bulky, rigid, and expensive systems take up substantial floor space and are hard-coded for a single workflow. Adapting to new tasks means weeks of downtime and reprogramming. As a result, companies often default to increasing headcount to keep up with demand.
What we do: Drop-in autonomous robot arms that deploy in days
Our first product ‚Äì Nemo3 ‚Äì is a bimanual robot that can handle objects within a 2.5-foot radius, supports payloads up to 4 lbs, and can be mounted flexibly in various environments. Unlike traditional robot arms, Nemo3 rapidly learns new tasks and adapts to changing conditions on the fly. Our AI decomposes 30 minutes of tele-operation data into skills and uses diffusion models to learn each skill. The result is fast and robust automation for our customers.
As one of our customers put it: ‚ÄúWhat surprised me most was how fast you set it up. After one weekend it was set up.‚Äù It took us just 4 days to get the robot deployed at ABClonal - from unpacking the robot to automating the vial packing task.
Who needs this
Our robots excel at dexterous manipulation tasks. Here are a few industries we can help:
DTC Meal Kits: Speed up meal kit assembly with automated packing.
Consumer Packaged Goods: Automate kitting to create variety packs with mixed SKUs.
Warehouses/Logistics: Sort parcels and pack irregular items faster and at lower cost.
Biotech: No more manual clean room disinfection or glovebox work

The Video:
Here is a video made by Golpo explaining Golpo.
https://youtu.be/3jyBks8QxQo
The Problem
Videos are incredibly time-consuming and tedious to make. You need to be an expert in video editing, sourcing, storyboarding etc‚Ä¶
But videos are the most engaging format to communicate information. A video can change someone‚Äôs mind in a way almost no other medium can.
Today, AI video models, like Sora and Veo 3, are not practical for communicating real information. They are great at making cinematic videos but cannot explain a 10-step onboarding flow, walk through a Github repo, train your team, or teach multivariable calculus. If you need to actually communicate something, no AI video tool would be useful for you.
Our Solution:
We have built a proprietary video generation engine to generate explainer videos from your documents.
Golpo is built specifically for use cases on explaining, learning, and reporting, and feels authentic and engaging in a way no other AI video generator does.
After Golpo generates a video, you can fully customize its animations frame by frame. Also you can make a video anywhere form 15 seconds to 30 minutes

Millions of shipments move across the U.S. every day, but booking carriers (trucking companies) to move them still happens over phone calls.
Lanesurf is a voice AI that helps freight brokers to book loads with vetted carriers at the best price, by negotiating rates across multiple calls in parallel.
Today, Lanesurf handles tens of thousands of carrier calls monthly for mid-sized US freight brokers, booking thousands of loads without human intervention.
ASK:

üëâ Email: founders@lanesurf.com
üëâ Book a call: Calendar
https://youtu.be/eSij3SDkBy0
‚ùå THE PROBLEM:
Freight still runs on phone calls. That‚Äôs where brokers lose deals, margin, and time.
To cover a single load, brokers often take 30‚Äì50 inbound calls from carriers.
On each call, they repeat the same load info, manually negotiate rates, and check compliance for each.
Brokers either use in-house reps or offshore teams but even then:
Missed calls from carriers offering better rates
Reps settle too quickly in negotiations just to close
High costs and churn
This is slow, expensive, and repeated 100s of times daily.
‚úÖ THE SOLUTION:
Lanesurf is Voice AI for carrier sales that:
Answers every call
Shares load details and vets carrier compliance
Negotiates rates using fuel prices, lane preferences & market trends
Makes outbound calls if no inbound match is found
This helps brokers:
Book more margin per load
4x lower costs to book a load
Even win more shipper loads by quoting reliably
Our AI gets smarter with every call learning patterns across lanes, carriers, and seasons - creating proprietary pricing signals brokers can act on.

AgentMail is an API that gives agents their own email inbox. Think of it like Gmail, but for agents instead of humans.
Why?
Because building email agents is hard enough, infrastructure shouldn‚Äôt be the bottleneck. Legacy providers like Gmail and Outlook
Lack API support for creating new inboxes
Charge monthly subscriptions per inbox
Impose restrictive rate and sending limits
Offer poor developer experience
These providers don‚Äôt scale with both inbox creation or volumes of emails sent/received that AI agents often face, so we‚Äôre rebuilding email infrastructure from scratch to enable this.
Solution
AgentMail is an API-first email provider that gives agents their own inboxes to send, receive, and act upon emails. Think of it like Gmail, but with
Automated, unlimited inbox creation and management
Usage-based pricing scaling with emails sent/received
No restrictive rate/sending limits

Deploy AI models locally, privately, and offline in any app using Cactus. Cactus is a blazing-fast inference engine optimized for smartphones and comes with React Native, Flutter, and Kotlin bindings.
https://youtu.be/xwKrmYkJZD8
Our framework:
Cactus is a cross-platform & open-source framework for doing inference on smartphones, wearables, and other low power devices. It supports any LLM or VLM available on HuggingFace directly.
The recently released Google AI Edge and Apple Foundation Frameworks are platform-specific and primarily support specific models from the companies.
To this end, Cactus:
Is available in Flutter and React-Native for cross-platform developers, since most apps are built with these today.
Supports any GGUF model you can find on Huggingface; Qwen, Gemma, Llama, DeepSeek, Phi, Mistral, SmolLM, SmolVLM, InternVLM, Jan Nano etc.
Accommodates from FP32 to as low as 2-bit quantized models, for better
efficiency and less device strain.
Have MCP tool-calls to make models performant, truly helpful (set reminder, gallery search, reply messages) and more.
Fallback to big cloud models for complex, constrained or large-context tasks, ensuring robustness and high availability.
So far, our customers have built:
Personalised and private RAG and prompt-enhancement pipelines for their app users.
Offline fallback for the big remote AI models.
Phone tool use agents like gallery & calendar management.
AI for medical and other privacy-pertinent industries.
Some demos:
LLMs and embedding models
Real-time vision inference
